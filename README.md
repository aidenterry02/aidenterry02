## About Me

A builder at heart. I design systems that solve real problems for real people.  
What motivates me is taking something complex or inefficient and rebuilding it into something clear, reliable, and easy to use.

I focus on automation, data workflows, and engineered solutions that remove friction and give people back time.  
My work is driven by impact, creativity, and the challenge of turning an idea into a system that actually works in the real world.

Long-term, I want to keep pushing deeper into automation and smarter, more adaptable systems.
